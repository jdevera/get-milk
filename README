									GET MILK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Description
===========

Get Milk is a Bash script that exports all pending tasks from a user's account
in Remember The Milk [1] (RTM from now on) into a text file.

The format of this text file is such that makes it ready to be used with Gina 
Trapani et al.'s task management software todo.txt-cli [2].



Usage
=====

Get Milk needs an output file name as a command line parameter, for instance:

$ ./getmilk.sh todo.txt



Requirements
============

Get Milk relies on several other tools that must be available in the system:

 * sed
 * awk
 * curl
 * md5sum
 * xsltproc (Although a different XSLT processor can be used, it would require
   some changes in the script; those changes are commented in the code)
 * A web browser

Get Milk also needs a valid RTM's API key, and the corresponding shared secret.
Both can be obtained easily from RTM [3]. Users must edit the script getmilk.sh
to replace the dummy values there with the real ones.



Conversion information
======================

RTM's task lists are exported as todo.txt-cli's projects (+ListName).
Spaces in task lists are replaced by underscores (_).
RTM's tags are exported as todo.txt-cli's contexts (@tag).
Locations, notes, due dates, etc. are discarded.



Assumptions
===========

The use of dates in the todo.txt file is assumed. If this is not the case, the
output file will need some additional processing. This could also be dealt with
within getmilk.sh in the future.

A simple RTM setup is also assumed. getmilk.sh has not been tested with any RTM 
account that included periodical tasks.



Development
===========

You can find this script's development site in github [4].
